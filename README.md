ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe in C++ (with BGI Graphics)

A graphical implementation of Tic Tac Toe built in C++ using the BGI graphics library on Dev-C++ (32-bit).

This project showcases my progress in learning C++ fundamentals, graphics programming, and basic AI logic.

âœ¨ Features

3x3 Board, neatly centered on a 1920x1080 window.

Two Game Modes:

ðŸ‘¤ Player vs Player (PvP) with custom name input inside the graphics window.

ðŸ¤– Player vs AI (PvAI) featuring a basic computer opponent.

Retro BGI Graphics for a classic look and feel.

ðŸš€ How to Run

**Put all files in same folder.**

**MAKE SURE TO CREATE IT AS A PROJECT IN DEV-C++.**

Install Dev-C++ 5.11 (32-bit compiler) or any compiler that supports graphics.h (WinBGI).

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-bgi.git.

Open the project in Dev-C++.

**Project Settings**
1. goto project settings.
2. Then Parameters --> Linker.
3. Add these linkers:
-lbgi

-lgdi32

-lcomdlg32

-luuid

-loleaut32

-lole32

4.Click OK.


Compile and run the game.

**Structure**

/Tic Tac Toe
 â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp             # Game source code
 
 â”œâ”€â”€ tic tac toe.dev      # Project File (open this to run)
 
 â”œâ”€â”€ tic tac toe.layout   # Project's Layout
 
 â”œâ”€â”€ graphics.h           # Required BGI graphics header
 
 â”œâ”€â”€ winbgim.h            # Additional graphics dependency

 â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
 

 **ðŸ“– Learning Outcomes**

Strengthened C++ basics: arrays, functions, structs, file handling.

Applied graphics programming concepts using graphics.h.

Gained experience with game logic and basic AI implementation.
